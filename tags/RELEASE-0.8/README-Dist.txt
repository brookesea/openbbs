The distribution contains the following files. You don't need all of them. Please
read this document to find the best option for you.

Note that the Commons Language utilities from the Jakarta Commons (http://jakarta.apache.org/)
are required by the OpenBBS framework. You need to add them to your classpath together
with the OpenBBS jar.

- OpenBBS-$VERSION$.jar
  This is just the compiled framework. The jar file contains the compiled classes only.
  You can add the file directly to your project.

- OpenBBS-$VERSION$-src-ide.jar
  This jar file contains the source-code for the OpenBBS framework. It's handy to make
  the sources available to IDEs such as Eclipse or IDEA.
  
- OpenBBS-$VERSION$-javadoc.zip
  The javadocs for the OpenBBS-Framework. You can either unzip this file to your hard-
  drive and read the documentation with a browser or make it available to your IDE.
  
- OpenBBS-$VERSION$-bin.zip
  Contains all of the three above files plus the dependencies which are required to
  run the OpenBBS framework.
  
- OpenBBS-$VERSION$-src.zip
  The OpenBBS source distribution. Contains everything you need to compile and package
  OpenBBS by yourself. It also contains the unit tests for the framework and the
  javadoc documentation.
